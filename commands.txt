###  Chainlens Setup Guide
## Project Overview
Chainlens is a blockchain explorer that allows you to visualize and interact with blockchain data. This guide will help you set up Chainlens using Docker and Docker-Compose.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker-Compose installed on your system. You can check if they are installed using the following commands:

## bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version

If these commands do not return version numbers, you will need to install Docker and Docker-Compose. Refer to the Docker installation guide and the Docker-Compose installation guide for detailed instructions.

###  Setup Instructions
## Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/web3labs/chainlens-free
Navigate to the Docker-Compose Directory

## bash
cd chainlens-free
cd docker-compose

## Log in to Docker
Log in to your Docker account:

docker login

## Update the docker-compose.yml File

If the NODE_ENDPOINT is not set up, you can directly set it up in the docker-compose.yml file. For example:

NODE_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8545

## Pull the Docker Images
Pull the necessary Docker images:

docker-compose pull

## Start the Docker Containers

To start the Docker containers with the default configuration:

NODE_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8545
docker-compose up
By default, the explorer runs on port 80. If you wish to use a custom port (e.g., 26000), you can start the containers as follows:

NODE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8585 PORT=26000
docker-compose up -d

## Special Instructions for MacOS and Windows
Due to limitations around the Docker network stack on MacOS, you need to modify the docker-compose.yml file. Specifically, remove the version number and change the NODE_ENDPOINT:

NODE_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:8545
Then, start the Docker containers:

docker-compose up

## Stopping the Containers
To stop the running Docker containers, use the following command:

docker-compose down
